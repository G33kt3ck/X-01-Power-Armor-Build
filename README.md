# X-01-Power-Armor-Build
This is a build design that i am working on for making the X-01 Power Armor. 

Goal
The plan here is to Build actual X-01 Power Armor from the Fallout 4 Game. The plan is to start small and work my way around the process. starting with the Frame and then moving to the actual armor Cover. 

Stage 1.
Build a platform for the armor to stand on.
   This should have the space for the Armor work station
   This will probably be the Smaller rounder work station like Found on the Prydwen (because i think it looks better.)
Consept Design Ideas.
  Cog,
  Layed down Vult door.
  
   
Stage 2.
Building the Power armor station in to the Frame.
  This will probably be the smaller round work station like found on the prydwen.
  Because of the want to actually making it functional. This will probably need to be made out of Metal.
  Will need to get ahold of a welder.
